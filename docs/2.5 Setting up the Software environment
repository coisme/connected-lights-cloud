There are multiple optiosn to develop code for Mbed.  A good choice for anyone starting with Mbed for the fisrt time is our online compiler which runs witin a web browser and doesn't require any installations.  For advanced users a command line tool might be a preferred method.  Partners in the Mbed ecosystem also develop professioanl tools that give ultimate flexibility with embedded development IAR is a high end tool in this category.

What about Keil and ARM DS and different compilers?
