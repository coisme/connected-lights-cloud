Now chapter 9

### Bringing it all together

Youâ€™ve already built almost all of the pieces required for the lighting system. You now have:

* The circuitry.
* The firmware.
* A connection to Mbed Cloud.
* A way of talking from a Node.js or Python app to the device.

You can now combine everything by building a web app that allows you to control the lights from anywhere in the world. For convenience, we built a `Node.js` mobile web app for you, which is in the `connected-lights-cloud` folder. The web app has the following features:

* Lists all the lights under your account.
* Changes the status of the light (from motion sensing to on/off).
* Quickly changes colors.
* Gets notifications whenever the PIR sensor detects movement.

Here is a screenshot of the app running on an Android phone:

*This is what the mobile interface looks like with two lights connected. Tap the color to change it.*

<span class="notes">**Note:** To give the lights a more friendly name (such as "living room"), change the name of the device in the Mbed Cloud Portal.</span>

#### Running the application

To start the application, first open `connected-lights-cloud/webapp/main.js`, and paste your mbed Cloud API key in the first line.:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
1. Navigate to `connected-lights-cloud/webapp`.
1. Install the dependencies:

    ```
    $ npm install
    ```

1. Run the application:

    ```
    $ node main.js
    ```

Open your web browser, and go to [http://localhost:5265](http://localhost:5265) to see the application running.

#### Konekuta

The web application is built on top of [Konekuta](https://github.com/armmbed/konekuta/tree/cloud), a framework for building dynamic web applications on top of Mbed Cloud. Konekuta solves a number of common problems with building connected applications, including state syncing, going offline/online, handling errors and updating the UI when devices connect or disconnect from Mbed Cloud. Konekuta is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/armmbed/konekuta/tree/cloud).


How do we host this on a live service rather than locally?
